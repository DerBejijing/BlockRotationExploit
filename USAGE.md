# BlockRotationExploit usage tutorial

## Starting the program
You can start the program by double-clicking or by running it from a terminal.  
Note, that there are some arguments you can specify when running from a terminal:  
`--help` shows a help menu  
`--master` starts the program as a master node over computing instances (slaves). Use this if you need a ton of computing-power.  
`--slave` starts the program as an already mentioned slave.  
Right now, these modes have no function yet.  


## Using the GUI
Use the interface to reconstruct grass/path blocks. The big window on the right is made of 49 squares that can be textured or not.  
To make them match the screenshot, you can rotate them with the "Rotate" button.  
In the example I will use this image below:

Start with the lowest, well-visible block as a center. Click in the middle of the big area and click "set textured". Rotate if neccessary.  
Do this for all adjacent blocks, but only if the rotation is clearly visible.  
In the end it might look like this:

Next take a look at the options:  
You select how many threads you would like to use. The more, the better but do not use more than you CPU offers.  
Enter a file name the program will use to save positive matches. if it does not end with .txt, it will do it automatically. If you don't specify a name, it will create a file of the format: `coordinates_`+`yyyy-MM-dd:HH-mm-ss`  
Set the minecraft version. At this point, only 1.12.2 and 1.16.5 are supported.  
The minimum y-value  
The maximum y-value  
The maximum radius  

Start cracking. You can abort at any time by clicking the button again, but try to avoid that as killing the threads that run the cracker is implemented REALLY badly and cruel.  
Can you find out where the image was taken?  


## Pro tips
Here are some tips to make the Program more efficient:  
If you see an ocean, consider that when setting y-min and y-max. Minecraft oceans are normally at y=62 so keep that in mind.  
If you see clouds or the sun you can find out the direction the player is looking towards. Use the "Lock rotation" option to use that information. (This makes it up to **four** times more accurate!  
If there are multiple blocks with the same relative rotation adjacent to each other, that will help the program a lot. Because of the algorithm behind it these occurrences are more rare and will help you narrow the results down more efficiently.  
The lines on the water texture are always pointing towards east or west.  
Sunflowers are always facing east.
