# BlockRotationExploit
I found a way to exploit the rotation minecraft applies to certain Blocks to reconstruct coordinates from them

**Rules**  
You are allowed to read and modify the source code of the program.  
You can make you own versions based on my discovery.

AS LONG AS...  
... you name me as the one to discover the technique  
... you name me as the programmer of this program  
... you do not use it commercially  


**About this project**  
When minecraft renders its blocks, certain blocks like grass, sand, gravel, concrete and many more get a random rotation asigned. Or so it appears to be. In fact, this rotation is not random so that when looking at a grass block (0, 0, 0) in two different worlds they will have the same absolute rotation.  
As I found out this can be exploited to narrow down where an image has been taken in a minecraft world (Coordinate Exploit) which plays a huge role on anarchy servers like 2b2t. This exploit is unefficient and requires a lot of practice to master it. Also the coordinates it generated are only within a certain range around the actual position an image was teken at. Although I am still happy that I found my very own first coordinate exploit.  


**How to use**
To use this program, you can either run it "normally" by double-clicking or execute it from a terminal window to get additional debug output. It was build for java 11 but might as well work for lower or higher java versions.  
In the following I will explain it with the use of grass blocks, but as mentioned it works with other blocks as well.  
In the GUI you can reconstruct the relative rotations you see in an image.

For example you pick teh block the crosshair is pointing at and transfer it into the programs GUI. Therefore you click one tile in the gray area and click the "set textured" button. Now you do that for adjacent blocks and, if neccessary, rotate them relatively using the "Rotate" Button. If a block is on a different y-axis, you can increase the layer-spinner. If you are not sure about one block, do not try to guess it. Errors will sum up.  
In the end it might look like this (for the upper image):

Next take a look at the options:  
You select how many threads you would like to use. The more, the better but do not use more than you CPU offers.  
Enter a file name the program will use to save positive matches if it does not end with .txt, it will do it automatically.  
Set the minecraft version. At this point, only 1.12.2 and 1.16.5 are supported.  
The minimum y-value  
The maximum y-value  
The maximum radius  

Start cracking. You can abort at any time by clicking the button again.  
Can you find out where the image was taken?  


**Pro tips**
Here are some tips to make the Program more efficient:  
If you see an ocean, consider that when setting y-min and y-max. Minecraft oceans are normally at y=62 so keep that in mind.  
If you see clouds or the sun you can find out the direction the player is looking towards. Use the "Lock rotaion" option to use that information. (This makes it up to **four** times more accurate!  
If there are multiple blocks with the same relative rotation adjacent to each other, that will help the program a lot. Because of the algorithm behind it these occurences are more rare and will help you narrow the results down more efficiently.  


**Bugs, coming features and fixes**  
At this point, the program is still in a beta version. some features like the saving option don't work yet. Also, if you find a bug, crash or want to rant over my bad coding style, please commit an issue over GitHub.
