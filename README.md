# BlockRotationExploit
I found a way to exploit the rotation minecraft applies to certain Blocks to reconstruct coordinates from them

## PROJECT UNMAINTAINED  
This project will no longer recieve updates and remains just for reference. Still, feel free to contact me about technical details.  
Some day I will reconsider this, as the current implementation is fataly flawed at certain points, so sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.

## About this project
When minecraft renders its blocks, certain blocks like grass, sand, gravel, concrete-powder and many more get a random rotation assigned. Or so it appears to be. In fact, this rotation is not random at all so that when looking at a grass block (0, 0, 0) in two different worlds they will have the same absolute rotation.  
As I found out this can be exploited to narrow down where an image has been taken in a minecraft world (Coordinate Exploit) which plays a huge role on anarchy servers like 2b2t. This exploit is unefficient and requires a lot of practice to master it. Also, the coordinates it generated are only within a certain range around the actual position an image was taken at. Although I am still happy that I found my very own first coordinate exploit.  



## Setup
You can download the source and compile it with the provided information below, or download a full release. But keep in mind that the releases may not include the latest features, as they will most likely also include many bugs.
To build the program, run  
`./build.sh` on linux/macOS  
`build.bat` on windows  
Before running on mac/linux, you may need to `chmod +x` it first.  
When executing it will compile everything to the jar file you can then run like normal, therefore please refer to the [usage section](https://github.com/DerBejijing/BlockRotationExploit#how-to-use). But because batch is such an obscure "language", I did not manage to prevent the script from copying everything twice to the final jar file. If you can fix it, I would be happy If you submitted a pull request.  
If you find errors, please open an issue, so I can fix it.  



## How to use
For usage, please refer to [USAGE.md](https://github.com/DerBejijing/BlockRotationExploit/blob/main/USAGE.md)  



## Contact
You can message me on discord (DerBejijing#2542) or use the github issue System..  



## Thanks  
I would like to thank
  - [MisterSilverEagle](https://github.com/MisterSilvereagle) for helping me research the minecraft source code  
  - [Hexeption](https://github.com/Hexeption) for providing an amazing tool to decompile and deobfuscate the minecraft source code  
  - the Minecraft mcp team for their tools to decompile minecraft  



## Bugs, coming features and fixes  
At this point, the program is still in a beta version. If you find a bug, crash or want to rant over my bad coding style, please feel free submit an issue or a pull request.  
Actually, this exploit will, with a few changes, work for even more blocks, like stone for example. They also get a "random" rotation assigned - but on ALL sides instead of only the top. Maybe I will include this in a future version.
